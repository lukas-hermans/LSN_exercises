  <p>
    In addition to simply visualizing a simulation trajectory, OVITO provides powerful animation capabilities,
    which let you animate the virtual camera, modifiers or visual parameters. The following sections explain OVITO's
    animation system in more detail.
    </p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/file_source_animation_panel.png" width="405"></div></div></div><p>
  </p>

  <div class="simplesect" id="idp2042656"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Animation frames vs. simulation frames</h3></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
       After loading a simulation sequence into OVITO, the timeline below the viewport area indicates
       the length of the current animation interval. Animation frame numbers start at zero in OVITO. Thus, an animation
       ending at frame 100, for example, consists of 101 video frames.
    </p>
    <p>
       It is important to point out the semantic difference between <span class="emphasis"><em>simulation frames</em></span>
       (i.e. the imported simulation snapshots) and <span class="emphasis"><em>animation frames</em></span>, which are
       the time units used by OVITO's animation timeline.
       Normally there is a one-to-one mapping between the two, i.e., the number of animation frames in OVITO's timeline is
       automatically adjusted to match the number of frames of the loaded simulation trajectory.
       This default behavior can be overridden in the <a class="link" href="animation.animation_settings_dialog.html" title="Animation settings">Animation settings</a> dialog.
       Then you will be in control of the animation length. If you extend the animation interval beyond the
       number of imported simulation frames, you will get additional static vide frames at the end of the rendered animation.
    </p>
    <p>
       Furthermore, the <a class="link" href="data_sources.html#scene_objects.file_source.configure_playback" title="Configure trajectory playback">Configure trajectory playback</a> dialog,
       which is accessible from the <a class="link" href="data_sources.html#scene_objects.file_source" title="External file">External file</a> panel (see screenshot),
       provides control of how the frames of the simulation trajectory
       get mapped to animation frames. The <span class="guilabel">Playback rate</span>
       setting allows you to specify a mapping that is not one-to-one. For example, a playback rate of
       1/2 stretches the simulation sequence to extend over twice as many animation frames. Each snapshot
       of the simulation will then be visible for two consecutive video frames. A playback rate of
       2/1, in contrast, compresses the playback of the simulation sequence to half of the animation frames.
       Then, every other simulation frame gets skipped in the rendered animation.
    </p>
    <p>
       The <span class="guilabel">Starting at animation frame</span> setting specifies where on OVITO's timeline the
       playback of the simulation trajectory begins. By default it starts immediately at animation frame 0, but you can
       change this number, e.g. to insert static frames frames at the beginning of a movie.
    </p>
    <p>
       Note that OVITO provides the possibility to insert several simulation datasets into one scene to show them
       simultaneously side-by-side or on top of each other. By default OVITO adjusts the length of the timeline
       to fully accommodate all loaded trajectories.
       </p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/animation_settings_dialog/animation_settings_dialog.png" width="324"></div></div></div><p>

  </div>

  <div class="simplesect" id="idp2052400"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Playback speed</h3></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      In the <a class="link" href="animation.animation_settings_dialog.html" title="Animation settings">Animation settings dialog</a>
      you set the playback speed (frames per second) of the current animation. This number determines the frame rate of
      video files produced by OVITO (e.g. AVI or MPEG). It also affects the playback within OVITO's viewports, which, however, typically
      occurs at a lower effective rate because loading the next simulation snapshot from disk can easily take too long to reach the
      realtime frame rate.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="simplesect" id="idp2056032"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Animating by means of time-dependent formulas</h3></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
       Simple animation effects can be readily achieved by using the <a class="link" href="particles.modifiers.expression_select.html" title="Expression selection">Expression selection</a>
       and <a class="link" href="particles.modifiers.compute_property.html" title="Compute property">Compute property</a> modifiers. These modifiers
       allow you to enter mathematical formulas or Boolean expressions to select subsets of
       particles or to manipulate certain particle properties (e.g. position, color, transparency, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
       Within such math expressions, you can incorporate the special variable <code class="literal">Frame</code>, which evaluates
       to the current animation frame number. Thus, whenever you reference this variable in an expression, the formula becomes
       time-dependent and OVITO will recompute the results on every animation frame.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="simplesect" id="usage.animation.keyframes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Animation via key frames</h3></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
       </p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/slice_modifier_animatable_parameter.png"></div></div></div><p>
       OVITO also provides a key-based animation framework. It lets you specify the value of an animatable parameter
       at certain animation times (for example at the beginning and at the end of the animation). In between these
       key frames, the value of the parameter is then determined using smooth interpolation (typically linear).
    </p>
    <p>
       </p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/keyframe_dialog.png" width="243"></div></div></div><p>
       The screenshot on the right shows the parameter panel of the <a class="link" href="particles.modifiers.slice.html" title="Slice">Slice</a>
       modifier as an example. Animatable parameters are indicated by an <span class="guibutton">A</span> button next to the input field.
       This button opens the animation key dialog for that parameter, which allows you to define
       new animation keys. Animation keys are time-value pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the next screenshot on the right, two animation keys have been defined for the <span class="emphasis"><em>Distance</em></span> parameter of the slicing plane,
       one at frame 0 and the other at frame 50. Thus, the parameter will have a value of 20.0
       at the beginning of the animation and reach 80.0 at the second animation key frame.
    </p>
    <p>
       Note that an animatable parameter always has at least one animation key.
       As long as there is only that single key, it defines the constant value of the parameter.
       Once you add another key OVITO will interpolate between the key values and the
       parameter actually becomes animated.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="simplesect" id="idp2069824"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Auto-key mode</h3></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
       The animation toolbar at the bottom of the main window contains a button with a key icon, which activates
       the so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto-key mode</em></span>:
       </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/key_mode_button.png" width="135"></div></div><p>
       While this mode is active, the time slider background is highlighted red and any change made to an animatable
       parameter in the program will automatically generate a new animation key at the current animation time.
       For example, after activating <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto-key mode</em></span>, you can jump to animation frame 0
       using the time slider and set the <span class="emphasis"><em>Distance</em></span> parameter of the Slice modifier to a value 20.
       You then go to the last frame of the animation and change the parameter value to 80.
       Each of the two parameter changes results in the creation of a new animation key at the corresponding animation time.
    </p>
    <p>
       Don't forget to deactivate <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto-key mode</em></span> after you are done creating the desired
       animation keys. Otherwise you might inadvertently define more keys for other parameters which you don't
       want to animate. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto-key mode</em></span> provides a convenient alternative for creating
       new animation keys, which can be faster than using the animation key dialog introduced in the previous section.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="simplesect" id="idp2076784"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Editing keys using the animation track bar</h3></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
       The <span class="emphasis"><em>track bar</em></span> is located right below the time slider and displays the created animation keys
       for the currently selected scene object and its parameters:
       </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/track_bar.png"></div></div><p>
       Each key is represented by a small marker at the corresponding position of the timeline. Positioning the
       mouse cursor over a marker will show the key's information in a small tool tip window.
       You can use the mouse to drag animation keys to a different position on the timeline.
       Right-clicking on a key opens a context menu which allows you delete the key.
    </p>
    <p>
       Note that the track bar will only display the animation keys of parameters that are actually animated,
       i.e., which have at least two keys defined. Thus, as soon as only one key is left, it
       will automatically disappear from the track bar.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="simplesect" id="usage.animation.camera"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Animating the camera</h3></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
       </p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/create_camera_function.png" width="270"></div></div></div><p>
       To animate the camera, you first have to create a <span class="emphasis"><em>camera object</em></span>. This is done
       from a viewport's <a class="link" href="usage.viewports.html#usage.viewports.menu" title="Viewport menu">context menu</a> as shown by the screenshot on the right. The new camera object will be
       placed in the three-dimensional scene at the current viewpoint.
       Furthermore, the active viewport will be linked to the new camera object so that when the camera is moved,
       the viewport will be updated to show the scene as seen through the new camera position. Conversely, if you use
       the zoom, pan, or orbit functions to adjust the viewport's view, the camera object in the scene will
       be moved accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
       </p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/viewports_with_camera.png" width="378"></div></div></div><p>
       The newly created camera object is visible in the other three viewports. You might have to zoom out to see it.
       Click on the camera object in the viewports to select it
       and show its parameters in the command panel. Alternatively, you can select the camera object using the
       object selector box located in the top right corner of the main window, which lists all objects in the
       current scene:
       </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/object_selection_box.png" width="270"></div></div><p>
    </p>
    <p>
       The camera object can be moved around in space using the <span class="guilabel">Move</span> tool and
       the <span class="guilabel">Rotate</span> tool in the main toolbar:
       </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/move_and_rotate_tool.png"></div></div><p>
       While one of these modes is active, you can drag the camera object with the mouse; or use
       the numeric input fields that appear in the status bar area, which let you enter the position coordinates and
       Euler orientation angles of the selected object:
       </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/usage/animation/numeric_move_tool.png" width="324"></div></div><p>
    </p>
    <p>
       Similar to other parameters, the position and the orientation of the camera object can be animated
       using the keyframing approach. To create animation keys for the camera position or rotation,
       you first have to activate the <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto-key mode</em></span> as described above.
       If you now change the camera's position at different animation times, animation keys will automatically be created
       and the camera will move on an interpolated path between the keyframe positions. The created animation keys are also shown in
       the <span class="emphasis"><em>track bar</em></span> while the camera is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
       By the way, instead of animating the camera's position, you can also animate the simulation box
       and let it rotate, for example. This is done in an analogous way by selecting the simulation box
       and using the <span class="guilabel">Rotate</span> tool while <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto-key</em></span> mode
       is active.
