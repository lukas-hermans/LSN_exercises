    This modifier constructs a surface representation of the three-dimensional shape formed by a set of 
    particles. It can thus generate a geometric description of the outer and inner boundaries of an atomistic 
    solid in terms of a triangulated <a class="link" href="scene_objects.surface_mesh.html" title="Surface meshes">surface mesh</a>. Besides visualization purposes 
    the geometric description of the surface is also useful for quantitative measurements of the surface area and the solid volume and porosity of an 
    atomistic structure.
  </p>

  <div class="simplesect" id="idp3662240"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">Introduction</h4></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      The modifier offers two alternative surface construction methods: The alpha-shape method and the Gaussian 
      density method, which will be described in more detail in later sections. Both approaches have specific advantages and limitations.
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>alpha-shape method</em></span> assumes that all particles are point-like, i.e., the atomic radii are ignored. Instead  
      the concept of a virtual probe sphere of finite size is used to define the accessible spatial volume (i.e. the empty, exterior region),
      the inaccessible volume (the solid, interior region) and the separating surface between the two. This approach provides the capability to quantify 
      filled and empty volumes or to analyze the porosity of a structure, for example. Furthermore, it exactly
      specifies which particles are located right at the surface, making it a well-defined criterion for selecting 
      surface atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second method offered by the modifier is based on a smeared-out representation of the finite-sized 
      particle spheres in terms of <span class="emphasis"><em>overlapping Gaussian distribution functions</em></span> centered at each particle. The resulting density field, 
      which is computed on a discrete grid, has local maxima at each particle site and decays to zero far away from any particles. 
      Next, the surface boundary is constructed as an iso-surface of the Gaussian density field, with the threshold chosen such that the 
      resulting isosurface roughly matches the finite diameters of the spherical input particles. This approach thus provides the advantage
      of accounting for the finite extent of the particles themselves, which is important for small molecules
      that do not form a bulk structure and in which a majority of atoms is at the surface.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="simplesect" id="idp3666320"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">General options</h4></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      The modifier provides the option to operate only on the subset of <span class="emphasis"><em>currently selected input particles</em></span>.
      This allows you to exclude certain parts of the system from the surface construction if needed. For example, to 
      ignore water molecules surrounding the structure of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total surface area of the resulting manifold is displayed by the modifier in the status area and 
      output as a <a class="link" href="usage.export.html#usage.global_attributes" title="Global attribute values">global attribute</a> named <code class="literal">ConstructSurfaceMesh.surface_area</code>.
      Note that the surface area is given in squared units of length as used by the original simulation dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      OVITO has the capability to associate local information with the surface mesh, which gets inherited from nearby particles during the construction process. 
      If the <span class="emphasis"><em>Transfer particle properties to surface</em></span> option is turned on, existing attributes of the input particles located at the surface, 
      for example their <code class="literal">Color</code> property, will be copied over to the vertices of the constructed 
      <a class="link" href="scene_objects.surface_mesh.html" title="Surface meshes">surface mesh</a>. The per-particle values will be available as  
      mesh vertex properties, and you can subsequently use tools like the <a class="link" href="particles.modifiers.color_coding.html" title="Color coding">
      Color coding</a> modifier to further manipulate the surface mesh, independently of the underlying particles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that, in case of the Gaussian density method, only continuous particle properties of data type <code class="literal">Float</code> will be transferred 
      to the surface. Discrete integer properties will be ignored, because the algorithm has to blend the property values of several particles
      to compute the value at each output mesh vertex. In case of the alpha-shape method, all types of properties can be transferred, because there 
      is a one-to-one mapping between particles and mesh vertices.
    </p>
    <p>
      </p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/modifiers/construct_surface_mesh_distance_calculation.png" width="270"></div></div></div><p>
      Upon request, the modifier can compute the distance of each particle to the closest point on the constructed surface. 
      The computed distances are stored as a new particle property named <code class="literal">Surface Distance</code>, which
      may subsequently be used to select particles within a certain range from the surface, e.g. using the <a class="link" href="particles.modifiers.expression_select.html" title="Expression selection">Expression selection</a> modifier.
      Note, however, that the distance calculation is a very expensive operation, which can take a long time for systems with many particles or a complex surface.
      If you just want to select particles located <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly on</em></span> the surface, then the 
      option "Select particles on the surface" should be used instead. It is only available for the alpha-shape method and lets the modifier
      directly select particles that are part of the surface mesh, i.e. which are touched by the virtual probe sphere.

      OVITO correctly handles systems with periodic boundary conditions (including mixed open and periodic conditions). 
      The simulation box here constitutes a periodic domain where the surface manifold is embedded in. The constructed surface may wrap around
      at the box boundaries and even reconnect to itself to form an infinite manifold. 
      Furthermore, there are two particular situations where the surface will turn out degenerate (i.e. a mesh with no faces): (i) A
      simulation box containing no particles or without particles forming any solid region, and (ii) a periodic simulation box densely and completely filled with particles.
      In case (i) there will be single space-filling empty region and in case (ii) a single space-filling solid region. 
      OVITO differentiates between the two degenerate cases when it comes to visualization of cap polygons.
    </p>
    <p>
      For visualization a surface cut by a periodic simulation box boundary is wrapped around and reenters on the opposite side of the 
      box. For the sake of clarity, the <a class="link" href="visual_elements.surface_mesh.html" title="Surface mesh (visual element)">surface mesh visual element</a> of OVITO provides the option to render
      so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>cap polygons</em></span> to close the holes in the surface that occur due to these cuts at the box boundaries. 
      Cap polygons make it easier for an observer to discern solid regions from empty regions.

      which is also the reference you should cite when publishing quantitative results obtained with this
      analysis tool. The method makes use of a Delaunay tessellation constructed on the basis
      of the input particle coordinates. It tessellates space into tetrahedral simplices, which are 
      subsequently classified as either belonging to a filled spatial region or an empty spatial region.
      Finally, the surface manifold is constructed as the separating boundary between the empty and the filled
      regions of space.

          (b) The circumspheres of two exemplary tessellation elements are highlighted.
          One element's circumsphere is larger than the probe sphere while the other one is smaller.
          Consequently, the elements are classified as open and solid, respectively. (c) The union of all
          solid Delaunay elements defines the geometric shape of the atomistic solid (bold line).
        </p></div>
      </div><p>
      The concept of a probe sphere with a prescribed radius (alpha parameter) is employed to assign each tetrahedral Delaunay 
      element to either the empty or the filled region. Generally, the empty region is defined
      as the union of all locations in space that are accessible to the virtual probe sphere without touching any of the input particle centers.
      Note that this includes any cavities inside the solid too as long as they can accommodate the virtual sphere without it overlapping
      with any particles. The radius of the probe sphere is a length scale parameter that determines how much detail
      and small features (e.g. pores) of the geometric shape will be captured by the method.

      The alpha-shape method, originally introduced by Edelsbrunner and
      Mücke [ACM Trans. Graph. 13:43&#8211;72, 1994], compares the circumsphere of the tetrahedral Delaunay elements (figure b) 
      to the probe sphere to efficiently decide which regions of space can accommodate the probe sphere without any overlap 
      and which thus become part of the empty spatial region. The remaining tetrahedra form the filled (solid)
      region. Finally, the closed surface mesh can be constructed, which consists of all triangular faces of the three-dimensional 
      Delaunay tessellation that separate solid from open tetrahedra (figure (c)).
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting surface mesh still reflects the atomic steps that are typically present on the surfaces of an atomistic object.
      The contribution of surface steps may lead to an overestimation of the macroscopic surface area. Therefore one can subsequently 
      apply a fairing procedure [Taubin, SIGGRAPH 95 Conf. Proc., pp. 351-358, 1995] to the surface mesh to smoothen out the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be emphasized that the results of the described surface reconstruction method will generally depend on the selected probe
      sphere radius parameter R<sub>&#945;</sub>. A rule of thumb for choosing R<sub>&#945;</sub> is to use the nearest neighbor atom
      separation distance in the material at hand as demonstrated in figure (a) on the right. OVITO allows you determine the first peak of the radial pair distribution 
      function g(r) with the <a class="link" href="particles.modifiers.coordination_analysis.html" title="Coordination analysis">Coordination analysis</a> modifier if needed.
      Generally, you should report the used value of R<sub>&#945;</sub> in your publications when measuring surface area, solid volumes, or porosities.

          <p>This parameter controls the radius of the probe sphere used in the surface construction algorithm, which

          a surface with less details, which reflects only coarser features of the surface topology.
          A small sphere radius, on the other hand, will resolve finer surface features and small voids inside a solid.
          However, the sphere radius should not be smaller than half of the typical interatomic
          distance. Otherwise artificial holes will appear in the constructed surface.</p>

      The density map generation algorithm accumulates Gaussian densities on a uniformly-spaced 3-D lattice defined within a
