# LSN Exercise Delivery

This is my (= Lukas Hermans') repository for the exercise delivery for the "Numerical Simulation Laboratory" course at the University of Milan. For detailed information on the course's content visit the dedicated [wep page](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/degree-programme-courses/2021/numerical-simulation-laboratory).

## Structure of the Repository
For each of the 12 exercises I created a folder with the name "exi" where i is the number of the corresponding exercise. Each folder contains a Jupyter-Notebook (e.g. "LSN_Exercises_01.ipynb") in which I present my solution to the exercise. In the header of each excercise solution, there is an explanation on the C++ code that is used for data generation and simulation.
