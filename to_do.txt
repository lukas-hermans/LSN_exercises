ex1:
    - avoid repetition for uniform, exponential and lorentzian distribution 

ex2:
    - make tools::prog_mean more efficient (do not always calculate whole sum)
    - implement p(x) = c(1-x^2) using rejection method

ex3:
    - make tools::prog_mean more efficient (do not always calculate whole sum)

ex4:
